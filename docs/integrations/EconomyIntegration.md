# EconomyIntegration

## Features
- Integrates with server economy plugins to reward or charge players based on AFK status or actions.

## Setup
1. Make sure both Vault and an economy plugin are installed on your server. 
	- We recommend using our plugin [EzEconomy](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1-7-1-21-ezeconomy-modern-vault-economy-plugin-for-minecraft-servers.130975/) for best compatibility and features.
2. Enable EconomyIntegration in the EzAfk configuration if required.
3. Restart the server to apply changes.
