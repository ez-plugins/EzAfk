# TabIntegration

## Overview
The TabIntegration module provides seamless compatibility between EzAfk and the TAB plugin, enabling advanced management of the player list and dynamic display of AFK status within the TAB interface.

## Features
- Automatically updates player list entries in TAB to reflect AFK status, including custom prefixes, suffixes, and formatting.
- Ensures real-time synchronization of AFK status changes with the TAB plugin.
- Supports integration with other plugins that modify player list names.
- No manual intervention required for updates; integration is fully automated.

## Setup & Usage
1. Install the [TAB plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/tab-1-5-x-1-20-x-free-version.57806/) on your server.
2. Ensure EzAfk is installed and running.
3. EzAfk will automatically detect and integrate with TAB if present.
4. AFK status and custom formatting will be reflected in the TAB player list without further configuration.

## Notes
- For advanced customization, refer to EzAfk's configuration options for display name formatting and AFK indicators.
- No additional setup is required; integration is automatic once both plugins are installed.
